# DND Character Sheets
# 
# A personal project in which I try to create an interface for D&D5e character sheets.
# I plan to optimize rules, stats, and features so that players won't have to manually account for features such as skill proficiencies, ability score modifiers, bonuses from class features, etc.
# Heavily inspired by the character sheets from DNDBeyond: https://www.dndbeyond.com
