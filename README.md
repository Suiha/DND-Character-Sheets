# DND Character Sheets
###### Language: Java

A personal project in which I try to create an interface for D&D5e character sheets. 
I plan to optimize rules, stats, and features so that players won't have to manually account for features such as skill proficiencies, ability score modifiers, bonuses from class features, etc.

This project is heavily inspired by the character sheets from DNDBeyond: *https://www.dndbeyond.com*

## Current Progress
I'm currently working on implementing the fundumental characteristics of a player character: ability scores, skill proficiencies, etc (not yet accounting for a user's decisions). Eventually I plan on adding very basic Race choices (such as human, elf, halfing) and Classes (not including Artificer or Blood Hunter).
